## Introduction

A React component to display App Store and/or Google Play badges based on the browser.

If the browser is an iPhone or iPad, only the App Store badge will be displayed. If the browser is running on Android, only the Google Play badge will be displayed. In all other cases, both badges are shown.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i react-store-badge
```

If you are using Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add react-store-badge
```

## Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import StoreBadge from 'react-store-badge';

function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Download Cheerswipe!</p>
      <StoreBadge
        name="Cheerswipe"
        googlePlayUrl="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.puyou.cheerswipe"
        appStoreUrl="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheerswipe/id1468158095?ls=1"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Page;
```
